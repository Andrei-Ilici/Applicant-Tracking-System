### What's next? ###

Currently, the team is searching for the best options to deploy the app online.
The end goal is to have a cloud application that can be easily accesible by possible candidates online. They will have acces to a form to fill in their data.
Our servers will securely process that data and automatically e-mail the people that do not meet the criteria letting them know they were unsuccesful.
A special algorithm will then use a traffic light system to split the people into a green group that definitely needs to be called for an interview, and an yellow one of possible candidates. Each will get a personalised e-mail automatically.

The system will make note of all the people it sorted, save a list, and inform the recruiter/hiring manager at the same time of the day about the decisions it took.
